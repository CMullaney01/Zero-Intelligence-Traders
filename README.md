# Zero-Intelligence traders
Hello and welcome to my investigation into zer-intelligence trading utilising the [Bristol Stock Exchange](https://github.com/davecliff/BristolStockExchange) please check out the abstract below!

## Abstract

Differential Evolution has been proposed as an
effective method for adapting the strategies of automated trading
agents in financial markets. However, optimisations of these
algorithms in a wide range of financial markets have not
been evaluated and could lead to economic inefficiency. This
paper investigates optimisations to Differential Evolution (DE)
implementations of automated trading agents in a wide range of
financial markets. Previous automated trading agents presented
in the literature are reviewed and an analysis of the DE algorithm
and possible optimisations are discussed. The behaviour of an
implemented DE automated trader is compared against the
proposed optimisation methods in a wide variety of financial
markets and results of experiments are given using a high-
fidelity simulation model of contemporary financial markets.
Using statistical analysis on the results proved that the proposed
optimisations increased the profit of a trader compared to already
existing DE implementations in most analysed markets.
